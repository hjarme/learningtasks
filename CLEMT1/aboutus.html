                            <p> The Stop Poverty statement is Give to care and Care to give. Our mission is to provide the basic needs of those, who can not provide for themselfs (or are not provided for by other means) and help them to become self-reliant and lead a decent life in dignity.

                                The Stop Poverty projects are focused on the basic needs of people, like Education and Health. At the same time our projects always aim at sustainability by realising local money generating initiatives like agriculture projects, micro finances and vocational training programs. The goal is, that these communities can continue to provide for their own population and children in health and education.</p>

                            <p>Stop Poverty does not provide fish, but a fishing rod and trains people to catch their own fish. Communities are impacted through our sustainable way of working. People and projects become self reliant.
