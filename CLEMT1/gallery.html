                Young man looks out at the highway sitting along side his dog in a congested slum on Aug. 21, 2012 in Manila, Philippines. Manila has a population of 20 million people which is rising by approximately another quarter of a million every year. Due to overcrowding a third of the city dwellers are forced to live on any bit of spare land they can manage mostly in makeshift settlements under bridges, railway lines and even cemeteries. Large families are a common statistic in a conservative Catholic county that is pushing the government's already weak social care system to it's limit.
