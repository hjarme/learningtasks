&bull; 500mls of real ale
              </p>

<b>Method</b>    
</p>
          <p>
1. Raw beef, roll it in the flour...fry 4&ndash;5 pieces at a time in a hot saucepan to    
seal...put to one side when all done 
</p>
          <p>
2. cut the onions into quarters...fry in the same frying    pan as the beef...to soak up the juices...    
    </p>
          <p>
3. Towards the end of frying the onion (they should be nicely brown round the edges)    throw in the smashed up cloves of garlic.    
    </p>
          <p>
4. Transfer the beef, onions, garlic to a deep casserole dish. Stir in the remaining flour    
    </p>
          <p>
5. pour on the bottle of beer &ndash; really,  it isn't going to be wasted!!!    
    </p>
          <p>
6. Cover, and cook at 150 for about 2 and a half hours...will be gorgeous when it comes out, trust me...serve with mash  </p>
