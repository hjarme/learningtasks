1.    Soak    the    porcini    mushrooms    in    hot    water    for    20    minutes.    Drain,    chop    and    
set    aside.    
              </p>
          <p>
    
2.    Mix    the    beaten    egg    and    two    thirds    of    the    Parmesan    cheese    in    a    large    bowl    to    
make    the    Carbonara    sauce.    Season    with    salt    and    pepper.   
              </p>
          <p>
    
3.    Cook    the    spaghetti    according    to    the    packet    instructions. 
              </p>
          <p>
    
4.    Meanwhile,    heat    the    oil    in    a    frying    pan    and    fry    the    bacon    for    3    minutes.    Add    
the    fresh    mushrooms,    porcini    mushrooms    and    garlic    and    cook    for    a    further    3&ndash;4    
minutes,    stirring    frequently. 
              </p>
          <p>
    
5.    Drain    the    spaghetti,    reserving    1tbsp    of    the    cooking    water.    Immediately    add    
the    pasta    to    the    Carbonara    sauce    as    well    as    the    reserved    cooking    water,    bacon    
and    mushrooms.    Toss    it    all    together    with    two    forks.    (The    egg    will    be    cooked    by    
the    heat    of    the    pasta,    and    the    sauce    will    cling    to    the    strands.)    Serve    
immediately    topped    with    the    remaining    Parmesan    cheese.
